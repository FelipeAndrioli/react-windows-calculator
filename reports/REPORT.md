# Detailed report from the development

In the point I started this report the front end it's almost complete
and I'm beggining all the back end.

I'll begin studing about Spring boot and microservices, to learn how
does this work and how I'm supose to use it in the back end to later
add all the others archtectures and patters.

In this first moment I believe that microservices are individual 
servers with all the business rules and with some end points to 
access it.

I'm alternating between my desktop and the work lap top, and due to this
some configurations can be different, because I'm not being able to run
the application on the lap top, so I am going to see the environment 
variables and java versions of my desktop to set it in lap top too.
